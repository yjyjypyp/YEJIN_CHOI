          MOTIVATION
        </h2>

        <p1>
          'From the Sun' is a mobile healing game presented to modern people living with electronic devices
          such as smartphones and tablets.
          It's a unique type of healing game that makes modern people
          who are used to the video think about what kind of situation we are in.
          <br><br>
          It has become a daily routine for modern people to access SNS, Webtoons, contents platform,
          and news more than once a day as a habit, even if there is nothing special to see.
          Also, with the development of the media, various kinds of videos and images can be seen,
          so people can easily enjoy the contents anytime, anywhere, regardless of their given time.
          This game is based on these modern habits and the story of this game goes on just by accessing it,
          just like watching other video contents.

          <h2>
            CONCEPT OF THE GAME
          </h2>

          Concept of the game is motivated from a poet 'From the sun to the boy'(1908) written by Nam-sun Choi.
          The story of the game begins as the lonely sun talks to the boy.
          You can build afffection through conversation with the sun, bring in animal or plant friends with them,
          or present natural objects and buildings to the sky(sun).
