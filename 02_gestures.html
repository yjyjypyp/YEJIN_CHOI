          MOTIVATION
        </h2>

        <p1>
          What kind of society will humans in the distant future recognize as they see 2020?
          <br>
          Beginning with the question of how we live in modern society,
          this work tried to understand and approach to the contemporary era as a "gesture."
          <br><br>
          According to the 'Gesture Theory' written by Vilhem Flusser,
          we can understand it's meaning and motivatoin by interpreting our gestures.
          Since the meaning and motivation of our gestures change depending on the times and environment,
          by understanding them, we can have more accurate access to the modern society.
          <br>
          This work is also an extension of the previously conducted research paper named
          "A Study of branding based on Vilem Flusser's Gesture Theory>"(2020).

          <h2>
          'Gesture of Exercising'
          </h2>

          Among many gestures, I thought 'Gesture of Exercising' is the best representation of modern society,
          since those are artificial movements we do compulsory but we don't do naturally in our daily lives.
          I extracted samples of exercising from high-viewed videos in You-Tube, and visualized in graphic style.
          As a moving poster, they were screened at several public spaces.
